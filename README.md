# Email validation API in Rust

Thanks for using our API! This is an API I run for demo purposes only. It is an experimental body of code, with many 
rapidly moving and changing parts.

This API will break often and badly until I declare 1.0, which can take a long time :)

## How to use

It's a simple API. Just pass it an email address like so

```
https POST https://url_to_api/v1/validate address=maxim@wzzrd.com

```
